Personal Expense Tracker Application
## Personal Expense Tracker Application

#### Simply put, personal finance includes all of the financial decisions and actions that a finance software facilitates by assisting you in effectively managing your finances. A personal finance software will not only assist you with accounting and budgeting, but it will also provide you with valuable advice on money management.</p>

#### Users of personal finance applications will be prompted to enter their costs, after which their wallet balance will be updated and displayed to them. Users can also receive a graphical analysis of their expenses. They can choose to establish a cap on how much can be used in that month, and if the cap is surpassed, the user will receive an email alert.

            <h2><p>A personal computer game, also known as a PC game or computer game, is a type of video game played on a personal computer (PC) 
                rather than a video game console or arcade machine. Its defining characteristics include: more diverse and user-determined gaming hardware 
                and software; and generally greater capacity in input, processing, video and audio output. The uncoordinated nature of the PC game market, 
                and now its lack of physical media, make precisely assessing its size difficult.
                 In 2018, the global PC games market was valued at about $27.7 billion.</p></h2>

          <h2><p>A mobile game, or smartphone game, is a video game that is typically played on a mobile phone. The term also refers to all games that
             are played on any portable device, including from mobile phone (feature phone or smartphone), tablet, PDA to handheld game console, 
             portable media player or graphing calculator, with and without network availability. The earliest known game on a mobile phone was
              a Tetris variant on the Hagenuk MT-2000 device from 1994.</p></h2>

      <h2><p>A console game is a type of video game consisting of images and often sounds generated by a video game console, which
         are displayed on a television or similar audio-video system, and that can be manipulated by a player. This manipulation usually
          takes place using a handheld device connected to the console, called a controller. The controller generally contains several buttons
           and directional controls such as analogue joysticks, each of which has been assigned a purpose for interacting with and controlling
            the images on the screen. The display, speakers, console, and controls of a console can also be incorporated into one small object 
            known as a handheld game..</p></h2>
